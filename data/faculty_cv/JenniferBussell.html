Clients and Constituents: Political Responsiveness in Patronage Democracies. Book manuscript, accepted for publication at Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press. Forthcoming in the Modern South Asia series with Oxford University Press.<br><br>In this book, I provide a theoretical and empirical examination of constituency service in developing countries. The predominant view of distributive politics in “patronage democracies” emphasizes the partisan targeting of pork and clientelism. In contrast, I demonstrate that high-level legislators in India and other contexts often provide direct, non-partisan assistance to individual constituents, whose electoral behavior they cannot conceivably monitor. Under what conditions do they provide constituency service, rather than engage in partisan bias? I show that the uneven character of access to services at the local level—often due to biased allocation on the part of local intermediaries—generates demand for help from higher-level officials, and also creates incentives for those politicians to bypass intermediaries by providing direct assistance. I draw on a novel data set with unprecedented parallel information on politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens; a large-scale field experiment with a near census of India’s state and national legislators; geo-located analyses of spending by legislators of constituency development funds; and evidence from in-depth qualitative shadowing of politicians in their constituencies. The book’s findings highlight the potential for an underappreciated form of democratic accountability, one that is however rooted in the character of partisan and patronage-based politics.<br><br>2.
